\subsection{Problem - Proof decision problems}

Proof that almost every decision problem is not solvable in finite time!

\subsection{Problem - Time complexity}

\subsection{Problem - P versus NP}

Explain the $P$ versus $NP$ problem!

\subsection{Problem - Maximum speedup}

Let $p$ be the number of parallel processes and $\pi$ denotes the fraction of code that can be parallelized.

\begin{itemize}
  \item Compute an upper bound for the speed-up that can be obtained by parallelizing the code.
  \item Visualize the (theoretical) speed-up for different values of $p$ and $\pi$.
  \item Explain the difference between weak and strong scaling.
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to illustrate the speed-up, which can achieved by parallelizing. For this reason, simulate $10^8$ gaussian random numbers with $\mu = 1$ and $\sigma = 2$. Distribute the simulation on $p = 1$ and $p = 2$ parallel processes. Estimate the required computation time with $m = 1000$ replications.


\subsection{Problem - Model selection}

In Figure , the efficiency of several models is given for the empirical example considered in Vetter, P., Schmid, W., Schwarze, R. (2016). Which model is the best under the following restrictions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item ${\Sigma}^{-1}\tilde{{Z}}$ should be computed in less than $0.01$ seconds
\item ${\Sigma}^{-1}\tilde{{Z}}$ should be computed in less than $0.2$ seconds
\item ${\Sigma}^{-1}\tilde{{Z}}$ should be computed in less than $0.5$ seconds
\item the mean squared prediction error should be less than $2$ and ${\Sigma}^{-1}\tilde{{Z}}$ should be computed as fast as possible
\end{enumerate}
